                This is the content for my first article.
                In classical Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman on Earth. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create her. 
                    So he did, using water and earth. The gods endowed her with many gifts: Athena clothed her, Aphrodite gave her beauty,
                    Apollo gave her musical ability, and Hermes gave her speech.

                According to Hesiod, when Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus took vengeance by presenting Pandora to 
                    Prometheus' brother Epimetheus. Pandora opens a jar containing death and many other evils which were released into
                    the world. She hastens to close the container, but the whole contents had escaped except for one thing that lay at 
                    the bottom â€“ Elpis (usually translated "Hope", though it could also mean "Expectation").

                Today the phrase "to open Pandora's box" means to perform an action that may seem small or innocent, 
                    but that turns out to have severely detrimental and far-reaching negative consequences.
